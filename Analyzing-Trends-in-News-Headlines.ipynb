    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "For my sources I decided to use the homepage of [RT](https://www.rt.com/), the politics page of [The Washington Times](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/politics/), and the politics page of [CBC News](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics). I choose these three news networks, because they were best known to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made a Python script `scraper.py` to scrape these individual webpages and collect news headlines at different times during the day. The script would scrape all three websites in the morning at around 11:00AM, then during the day at around 14:00PM. and finally in the evening at 18:00PM. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for having three different news networks and setting the script to scrape at differnt times throughout the day, is because I was trying to get as much variation as possible, to help me find more patterns from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automating Work\n",
    "\n",
    "To save my self the time and headache of remembering to scrape the websites at certain times, I spun a simple Ubuntu droplet on DigitalOcean. I used the [Python Schedule package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/schedule) to automate the script to run at specific times throughout the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script as a background process I used the following command `nohup python3 scraper.py > scraper.out 2>scraper.err &`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Watson API\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the news headlines I used IBM's Watson [Natural Language Understanding](https://natural-language-understanding-demo.mybluemix.net/) API. The Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a collection of differnt APIs that analyze text to help you understand its concepts, entities, keywords, sentiment, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every news headline I requested the sentiment (provides a score for text either negative, positive, or neutral), emotions (joy, anger, disgust, sadness, and fear), and entities (identifies people, companies, countries, etc.) to be returned by the NLU API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraper Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a chunk from the `scraper.py` script, the chunk is used to scraper, analyse, and then write the information (news headlines and their analysis) to a `.txt` file from the RT homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def RT():\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "            for li_tag in ul_tag.find_all('li', {'class': 'main-promobox__item'}):\n",
    "                for headline in li_tag.find_all('a', {'class': 'main-promobox__link'}):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
